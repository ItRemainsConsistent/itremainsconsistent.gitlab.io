<h1 class="centered">About Me</h1>

My name is Isaac Elliott. I am studying Software Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Queensland and am pursuing career as a full-time Software Engineer.

I have yet to settle in to any programming niche; consequently I endeavour to acquire a
broad set of development skills. Functional programming, game development and web 
design/development are all prominent interests of mine.
