<h1 class="centered">About me</h1>

Hello!
I'm Santiago Pareja-PÃ©rez, a PhD student from Zaragoza (in Spain).

I am currently studying plane curve singularities, but did my [master's thesis](https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14352/105943) on the classification of TQFTs.
A list of research interests will appear here eventually.

<h1 class="centered">About this blog</h1>

In this blog I will mostly cover the topics I am currently researching, but if it goes well I'd like to use it as an excuse for some forays into the unknown.

As mentioned in the [Initial Commit](/initial-commit), the codebase for this webpage was forked (with permission) from [Isaac Elliott's blog](https://github.com/LightAndLight/lightandlight.github.io).
