<h1 class="centered">About Me</h1>

My name's Isaac. I used to work in the [Queensland Functional Programming Lab](https://qfpl.io) at Data61 / CSIRO, and I'm currently taking some time off between jobs. I'm particularly interested in programming language theory, functional programming, and formal verification.
