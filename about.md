<h1 class="centered">About Me</h1>

My name's Isaac. I'm currently studying Computer Science part time at the University of Queensland. I'm particularly interested in programming language theory, functional programming, and theorem proving.

My dream is to be paid to write Haskell- and it looks like this will soon be coming true. More details later in June :)
