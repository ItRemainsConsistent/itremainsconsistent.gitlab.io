# About me

Hello!
I'm Santiago Pareja-PÃ©rez, a PhD student from Zaragoza (in Spain).

I am currently studying plane curve singularities, but did my master's thesis on the classification of TQFTs.
Check it out over at the [Documents page](/documents), if you are curious!

## Research interests

A list of research interests will appear here eventually.

## About this blog

In this blog I will mostly cover the topics I am currently researching, but if it goes well I'd like to use it as an excuse for some forays into the unknown.

The internals of the blog use [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) as a static site generator and [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) as a comment system.
As mentioned in the [Initial Commit](/initial-commit), the codebase was forked (with permission) from [Isaac Elliott's blog](https://github.com/LightAndLight/lightandlight.github.io).

This webpage is deployed on GitLab Pages, and the source code is available on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ItRemainsConsistent/itremainsconsistent.gitlab.io) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ItRemainsConsistent/itremainsconsistent.gitlab.io).
