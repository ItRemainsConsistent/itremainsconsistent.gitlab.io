*This essay is a message to myself mixed with some recent thoughts that have
repeatedly occurred to me*

I remember when I first learned about computer programming, around 2008 or 2009.
I wanted to make games, and asked google. At the time, I could barely even
conceive of graphics programming, so I wanted to create browser-based static
HTML games and text-based roguelikes. I have a distinct memory of sitting down
and brainstorming a setting, classes and roles for characters, and imagining how
battles might work. I also remember not being able to build any of it. Even the
simplest programs were incredibly difficult, and the complexity of a browser
game was beyond me. I consider myself lucky that I didn't give up on programming
after realising I wasn't able to build any of my cool ideas. Somewhere along the
way I was enthralled by the ability to make computers do things, and my learning
became self-propelled - games be damned.

Compare this with how I've approached another activity that I'm compelled to do,
but very bad at: creative writing. For a while now I've been interested in
telling stories, and this has been my learning process so far: 

"I want to write stuff. Not just stuff, but *cool* stuff; interesting stuff. But
I don't have any cool ideas! Guess I won't write about anything then."

In other words: I've learned *nothing*, because I haven't *done* anything. Now,
I think there are people
