*This essay is a message to myself mixed with some thoughts that have come up in
a couple of different places*

I remember when I first learned about computer programming, around 2008 or 2009.
I wanted to make games, and asked google. At the time, I could barely even
conceive of graphics programming, so I wanted to create browser-based static
HTML games and text-based roguelikes. I have a distinct memory of sitting down
and brainstorming a setting, classes and roles for characters, and imagining how
battles might work. I also remember not being able to build any of it. Even the
simplest programs were incredibly difficult, and the complexity of a browser
game was beyond me. I consider myself lucky that I didn't give up on programming
after realising I wasn't able to build any of my cool ideas. Somewhere along the
way I was enthralled by the ability to make computers do things, and my learning
became self-propelled - games be damned.

Compare this with how I've approached another activity that I'm interested in,
but very bad at: creative writing. For a while now I've wanted to learn how to
tell stories, and this has been my process so far: 

"I want to write stuff. Not just stuff, but *cool* stuff; interesting stuff. But
I don't have any cool ideas! Guess I won't write about anything then."

In other words: I've learned *nothing*, because I haven't *done* anything.
It's easy to imagine that people get stuck in similar situations with learning
to code - "I want to learn to program, but I don't know what to build". So I'm
going give advice from a programming perspective, but generalised so that it
applies to other areas. Ideally, this will give me a better handle on how to
approach learning other crafts.

## Drop your standards and shelf your ideas

At the start of the learning process, we have barely any ability in the area.
This means that by most standards, you will produce a lot of terrible, unskilled
work. But that's okay, because at this stage each piece of work is a step toward
improvement. Each thing you make exists so that you can figure out how to make
the *next* one better. If you have any grand designs, put them on hold. Chances
are you don't have the ability to see them through right now. Sometimes lofty
ideas can help you figure out which areas to study. For example, if your dream
is to make a first person shooter then you should definitely learn about 3D
graphics. But I think it will generally help to put the big ideas aside until
you're more skilled.

## Make EVERYTHING

When I was learning to code, I made calculator and to-do list apps, tiny
database-backed webapps and 2D space shooters and brick breakers. None of this
was remotely novel; it was a challenge just to repeat what others had
built before me. Even though I wasn't building anything original, I was still
creating something that *I* had never made before, which was a huge learning
experience. Even simple programs, like a calculator, required important
fundamental skills that I didn't have. I encountered problems that
had been solved countless times by others, but that didn't diminish the value of
solving them for myself.

Getting into this mindset seems especially difficult in more 'creative' fields
like writing and visual art. It feels like in these areas, there's a big
emphasis on being unique, imaginative, and innovative. While this is definitely
true for the top performers, it's the wrong way for beginners to approach a
craft. Making shiny new stuff comes later; right now you need to re-make old
stuff.

Replicating past work doesn't mean to copy things out line by line. It's the
idea that you should copy, and the details should come from you. When I sat down
and said "I'm going to write a brick breaking game", I didn't go and cut
sections out of other similar games. I took the un-original concept, broke it
into smaller components, and figured out how to make each of those bits. Each of
those sub-problems required original thinking on my part, and it's this original
thinking that drove my improvement.

## Find joy in the process

The easiest way to improve a skill is to find a helpful source of motivation. I
think the least sustainable motivational source is 'to get good at' something.
If this is your motivation, then you'll be in a constant state of discouragement
as you practise; comparing yourself now (an unskilled beginner) to where you'd
like to be (a skilled expert). Practise sessions become a reminder of how bad
you are, and you start to resent it all.

A better motivational source is 'improvement'. With this perspective, you
feel accomplishment whenever you notice that your skills have increased, which
happens often for beginners who practise regularly. But improvement-based
motivation isn't enough on its own; there are periods where you won't notice
improvement, but it's important to practise anyway.

The most important and fundamental source of motivation comes from enjoying the
activity itself. If you are focussed on things you enjoy about the craft that
aren't connected to your personal standards, then it doesn't matter how 'bad'
your work is in the beginning, because producing it was a joy in itself. Now
layer on the desire to improve, and the desire to produce 'good' work, and you
have a healthy hierarchy of motivation.
