title: Gear Acquisition Syndrome

In the past few years I've become wary of a certain relationship dynamic with my artistic hobbies
like drawing and music production. It's this period of excitement and "motivation" after I've acquired
some new art-related material. It's very easy to spend hours doodling with a new marker, writing
in a fresh journal, or twiddling with a synth I've just bought. The next day, though, the new tool
is a little less exciting, and so on, until it's as normal as everything else.

In situations like these it seems easy to mistake the excitement of novelty for actual interest in
an artistic process. I find it kind of scary to imagine accidentally convincing myself that creativity
and motivation follows from having bought something new.

This topic came to mind recently after reading
["When the Cymbals Come In" by Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/when-the-cymbals-come-in)
where I was introduced to the term "Gear Acquisition Syndrome" (GAS). The blurb of
["Gear Acquisition Syndrome: Consumption of Instruments and Technology in Popular Music" by Jan-Peter Herbst & Jonas Menze](https://unipress.hud.ac.uk/plugins/books/27/)
defines it very nicely:
  
> Gear Acquisition Syndrome, also known as GAS, is commonly understood as the musicians’ unrelenting urge
> to buy and own instruments and equipment as an anticipated catalyst of creative energy and bringer of happiness.

Parts of GAS describe the relationship toward my tools that I've been trying to avoid. It's
relieving to find a concise, searchable term that gets me into the same "informational neighbourhood".

Another component of GAS is a kind of compulsion to collect, like for a few of the "gassers" described in
[this GuitarWorld article](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/gear-acquisition-syndrome),
and [this article](http://sdarchive.com/gas.html) by [Walter Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Becker).
I've never had this problem. My concern is around using "gear acquisition" as a twisted crutch to produce
*some kind* of creative output.

Here's what I'm imagining:

Suppose that some creative pursuit (say, painting) is a large part of my identity. I think of myself as *a painter*,
and the idea that I create paintings is almost existentially important to me. If I'm a painter and I don't paint,
then *what even am I*? There one problem: I haven't painted anything in months. These days I never have any good ideas,
and I'm rarely inspired or motivated to pick up a brush. One day I stumble across a video of someone painting with
[gouache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouache). I feel something when I see that painting&mdash;inspiration, maybe?&mdash;
and I've never used gouache before, so I head out to the art store to buy some. I arrive home excited to try these
new paints. In the hours that follow I have fun fooling around, and the part of me that sees myself as a painter
is satisfied: I'm doing the thing that I'm supposed to be doing. As days and weeks pass the excitement fades, and
the pressures of everyday life eclipse my painting practise. One day I realise: 

There have been times when I felt like I "should be" create things

* Danger of confusing the excitement of novelty with enjoyment of the craft
  * Spending hours drawing on the new paper I bought, playing with some new paints, or fiddling with a new synthesiser.
* A heuristic I use for working around this
  * Must be continuously practising with the tools you have
    * Tools serve the art, rather than the art serving the tools
  * Improve skills, especially perception, until you clearly notice how your current tools are limiting you in your projects
  * Then acquire new tools that help you overcome these new limitations
  * When this heuristic is working for me, getting the new tool feels more like "relief" instead of "excitement"
    * I'm already doing the the art, so I'm enjoying the feeling of being able to do it better
    * Rather than being excited to *start* doing the art because I've just gotten this new tool
* "Gear Acquisition Syndrome" - learned from 
  * Results from Google front page
    * According to a [Guitar World article on the subject](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/gear-acquisition-syndrome),
      the phrase was first used by  in an article titled ["G.A.S. Attack"](http://sdarchive.com/gas.html).
    * ["The Science of Gear Acquisition Syndrome" by Joshua Sariñana](https://www.joshuasarinana.com/the-science-of-gear-acquisition-syndrome)
      has a neuroscientific and philosophical take on GAS in the context of photography
