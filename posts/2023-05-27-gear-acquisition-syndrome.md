* Danger of confusing the excitement of novelty with enjoyment of the craft
  * Spending hours drawing on the new paper I bought, playing with some new paints, or fiddling with a new synthesiser.
* A heuristic I use for working around this
  * Must be continuously practising with the tools you have
    * Tools serve the art, rather than the art serving the tools
  * Improve skills, especially perception, until you clearly notice how your current tools are limiting you in your projects
  * Then acquire new tools that help you overcome these new limitations
  * When this heuristic is working for me, getting the new tool feels more like "relief" instead of "excitement"
    * I'm already doing the the art, so I'm enjoying the feeling of being able to do it better
    * Rather than being excited to *start* doing the art because I've just gotten this new tool
* "Gear Acquisition Syndrome" - learned from ["When the Cymbals Come In" by Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/when-the-cymbals-come-in)
  * Results from Google front page
    * According to a [Guitar World article on the subject](https://www.guitarworld.com/features/gear-acquisition-syndrome),
      the phrase was first used by [Walter Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Becker) in an article titled ["G.A.S. Attack"](http://sdarchive.com/gas.html).
    * ["The Science of Gear Acquisition Syndrome" by Joshua Sariñana](https://www.joshuasarinana.com/the-science-of-gear-acquisition-syndrome)
      has a neuroscientific and philosophical take on GAS in the context of photography
      * Book suggestion: Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland
    * The blurb of ["Gear Acquisition Syndrome: Consumption of Instruments and Technology in Popular Music" by Jan-Peter Herbst & Jonas Menze](https://unipress.hud.ac.uk/plugins/books/27/)
      puts it very nicely:
  
      > Gear Acquisition Syndrome, also known as GAS, is commonly understood as the musicians’ unrelenting urge
      > to buy and own instruments and equipment as an anticipated *catalyst of creative energy* and bringer of happiness.
