I didn't know that another Diablo game was coming until I saw advertisements for [Diablo 4](https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/) on buses around the city.
Around the same time I was researching the origins of [Guild Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars), one of my favourite games from my early teens.
I learned that the early [Blizzard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment) games&mdash;Warcraft, Warcraft 2, Diablo, and Starcraft&mdash;are sort of "direct technical ancestors" to Guild Wars:
[ArenaNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArenaNet), the studio that created Guild Wars, was created in 2000 by some important former Blizzard employees.
[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/1faaOrtHJ-A?t=143) of [Patrick Wyatt](https://www.codeofhonor.com/) (one of ArenaNet's founders) talking about network programming in Warcraft, Diablo, and Guild Wars.
Combined with my general sense of the Diablo series' renown in video game history, I started getting curious about what the Diablo games would be like to play.

I'm kind of allergic to buying something as highly advertised as Diablo 4, and it currently costs AUD110 which is a bit expensive relative to my mild sense of curiosity.
I'm also skeptical of more modern "loot-based" or "progression-based" games, where there's potential for a sort of "superficial feel-good feedback loop": increasing your character's stats so that you can fight stronger enemies so that you can increase your character's stats, ad infinitum.
This ruled out Diablo 3 for the time being.
Faced with the choice between Diablo 2 and Diablo 1, I chose the original.
Might as well start at the beginning.
I recently finished the game[^buy], and this post is about my experience.

[^buy]: I bought the [DRM-free version of Diablo 1 + Hellfire on Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo).
