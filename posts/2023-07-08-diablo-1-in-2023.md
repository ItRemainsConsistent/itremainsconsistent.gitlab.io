I didn't know that another [Diablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(series)) game was coming until I saw advertisements for [Diablo 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_IV) on buses around the city.
Around the same time I was researching the origins of [Guild Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars), one of my favourite games from my early teens.
I learned that the early [Blizzard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment) games&mdash;Warcraft, Warcraft 2, Diablo, and Starcraft&mdash;are sort of "direct technical ancestors" to Guild Wars:
[ArenaNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArenaNet), the studio that created Guild Wars, was created in 2000 by some important former Blizzard employees.
[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/1faaOrtHJ-A?t=143) of [Patrick Wyatt](https://www.codeofhonor.com/) (one of ArenaNet's founders) talking about network programming in Warcraft, Diablo, and Guild Wars.
Combined with my general sense of the Diablo series' renown in video game history, I started getting curious about what the Diablo games would be like to play.

I'm kind of allergic to buying something as highly advertised as Diablo 4, and it currently costs AUD110 which is a bit expensive relative to my mild sense of curiosity.
I'm also skeptical of more modern "loot-based" or "progression-based" games, where there's potential for a sort of "superficial feel-good feedback loop": increasing your character's stats so that you can fight stronger enemies so that you can increase your character's stats, ad infinitum.
This ruled out Diablo 3 for the time being.
Faced with the choice between [Diablo 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_II) and [Diablo 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)), I chose the original (which from now on I'll just call "Diablo").
Might as well start at the beginning.
I recently finished the game[^buy], and this post is about my experience.

## Music

Diablo turned 26 this year.
It's the second oldest game I've played, after [Myst (1993)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst).
Many elements of the game, such as graphics, gameplay, and narrative show their age and have been obsoleted by modern titles.
The part of the game that I think has aged the best, and impressed me the most, is the music.

The [Tristram theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnMR6SOBa9k) plays every time you return to the town after dungeon crawling.
Every time I listen to it, it evokes feelings of spaciousness and release, while still keeping a sort of dark undertone.
I never found myself getting bored by it while wandering around town.
Some of my favourite parts are:
the open acoustic guitar chords with ping-pong delay ([00:00](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=0), [01:35](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=95)),
the use of guitar harmonics ([00:29](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=29), [01:29](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=89)),
the brooding fingerstyle melody ([00:44](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=44)),
the reverbed recorder-sounding flute instrument ([01:40](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=100)),
and creative slide effects ([02:10](https://youtu.be/AnMR6SOBa9k?t=130)).
The whole song is wonderful.
As a bonus: [8-bit music theory](https://www.youtube.com/@8bitMusicTheory) recently did [an analysis of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F_zsDWJyrM) which I really enjoyed.

As you venture deeper into the dungeon under the town, the music gets increasingly creepier.
I found it unsettling and unpleasant at times, especially when I entered a new area for the very first time with no idea what I'd find.
The use of vocal samples, such as
[pitch-shifted / reversed laughter](https://youtu.be/gXUcwprvldc?t=822),
[crying babies](https://youtu.be/gXUcwprvldc?t=878),
[creepy moans and ragged breathing](https://youtu.be/gXUcwprvldc?t=1170),
made the creepy atmosphere more "personal".
Even though this is an isometric game (not the most immersive of viewpoints), there were times when I actually felt jumpy and on edge.
I think the music was largely responsible for this.

Having finished the game once I probably won't play Diablo again, but I will *definitely* revisit the soundtrack.

[^buy]: I bought the [DRM-free version of Diablo + Hellfire on Good Old Games](https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo).
