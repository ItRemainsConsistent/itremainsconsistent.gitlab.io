Last month, I started reading about the singularities of plane algebraic curves.
Some of the core concepts have clicked in my head, while others still need more work done.
Writing about it should help reveal more of these blind spots, and consolidate some of the insights obtained --- that's the reason why I started this blog.

Since I am writing these articles mainly for myself, the prerequisites will almost certainly vary wildly from post to post.
I will however try to keep things reasonable.
Feel free to propose topics you would like to see explored in more depth.

Without further ado, let us explore the world of singular points of plane algebraic curves.

## What is a singularity?



## Resolution of singularities



For those familiar with derived functors, this might remind you of resolutions of modules --- in both cases, you have an object $M$ which you study by taking a family of better-behaved objects $F_i$ equipped with maps between them:

$$
    \cdots \to F_n \to \cdots \to F_1 \to F_0 \to M.
$$

This will probably be relevant once we study the homology of blow-ups, which is a topic I have not read upon yet.
It could also be a coincidence, or (more likely) evidence of an eponym --- that is, maybe one of these concepts was named after the other, in virtue of their similarity.
<!--- TODO: I should check what the relationship here is.-->
