  Every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation.

I've wanted to start a math blog for some time now, since I feel like writing forces me to understand things more deeply.
Research work is a monumental task which never truly ends, so dividing it into smaller tasks helps to mantain long-term motivation --- something which I am remarkably bad at.
Setting a deadline for each post also helps me get work done instead of endlessly trying to refine it in an endless chase for perfection.[^fork]

My initial commitment is to prepare a small weekly post for each Friday, but this may change as I find out which workflow fits me best.
Let's hope that is a reasonable schedule!

I hope I can come back to this blog in a few months' time, having already forgot where I learnt about each little piece of knowledge, and use the written corpus as a collection of references.

See you around!

[^fork]: On that same note, I have decided to fork another Hakyll-powered blog instead of doing the setup from scratch --- my inner Fedora user won the war against my inner Arch user.
Many thanks to Isaac Elliott for his permission and assistance!
Check out [Isaac's blog](https://blog.ielliott.io/), from which I borrowed all the code and formatting.
I will most definitely tinker with both layout and internals at some point in the future, but for now I am happy to have a functional and pretty setup so that I can avoid technical rabbit holes and just start writing posts.
